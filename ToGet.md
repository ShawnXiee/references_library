    > **摘要**:随着互联网应用的推广和普及，在线健康咨询服务得到迅猛发展，将传统的线下交流拓展到线上，知识传播迅速，对增强大众健康意识、降低就医成本（特别是搜索医生成本）、提高医生竞争意识和促进公平有重要意义。
    > 
    > 本文主要考察了三方面的内容:1）从信息不对称的视角考察了在线健康咨询市场中价格溢价的问题;2）研究了声誉和努力程度对医生收入的影响;3）医生的差异化分工对于在线服务价格和收入的影响。根据在线健康咨询市场的特点，分别搭建信号机制模型，从不确定性角度，分析医生服务经验、疾病隐私程度和疾病严重程度对信号机制的调节作用。我们针对四种疾病（糖尿病、胰腺癌、小儿肺炎和不孕不育），从好大夫网站上抓取面板数据，来验证所提的研究模型和假设。
    > 
    > 研究结果表明，地位和声誉对于价格溢价均有显著的正向影响，医生服务经验、疾病隐私程度和严重程度其调节作用。声誉和努力程度对医生收入也都有显著的正向影响，两者存在交互作用，地位和疾病严重程度对医生收入也有调节作用。医生的在线差异化分工对于在线健康咨询价格和在线收入都有显著的正向影响。
    > 
    > 本文旨在探索线上线下信号机制对于医生收入、价格溢价的信号作用，提高医生对线上医疗事业的重视，帮助患者合理决策。研究调节机制的作用，帮助医生进行合理长远的规划，对于医院和平台未来发展具有重要的现实意义。

- [ ] Differentiation strategy in online physician competition: Does specialization matter? (Preprint)

      DOI: 10.2196/preprints.7529

    > **ABSTRACT**
    > 
    > **Background**:<br>
    A successful product differentiation strategy leads to competitive advantages and higher profits for firms, and this is also the case for the hospital industry. However, we do not know whether a physician’s specialization differentiation strategy will have any impact on her online income in an e-Consultation market; nor do we know the market conditions under which this strategy will be more effective.  
    > 
    > **Objective**:<br>
    We aim to investigate how a specialization differentiation strategy impacts a physician’s online income and the market conditions under which a specialization differentiation strategy has stronger effects.  
    > 
    > **Methods**:<br>
    We employed secondary data in an econometric analysis of transactions obtained from an e-Consultation website (haodf.com) for four diseases (infantile pneumonia, diabetes, infertility, and pancreatic cancer) from 2008 to 2015. A total of 1160 physicians were included in the analysis.  
    > 
    > **Results**:<br>
    Specialization, the differentiation strategy, has a significant positive impact on the physician’s online income (β =0.011, p < 0.001). Moreover, specialization will improve a physician’s competitive advantage when market competition is more intense (β =0.116, p < 0.001).  
    > 
    > **Conclusions**:<br>
    Physicians whose expertise is differs from that of the majority have higher online incomes, and this impact will be stronger when market competition is more intense. Our study indicates that e-Consultations may accelerate the specialization trend observed in the health care industry because the online market favors more-specialized physicians, and competition in the online market is stronger than in the offline market. Such an impact may be positive for some very complicated diseases but less positive for some chronic diseases. Policy makers should be careful with the double-edged sword of e-Consultation.
